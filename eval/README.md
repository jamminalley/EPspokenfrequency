`lemma_gold.tsv` — hand-checked lemmatization gold set.

How it was sampled: surface forms counted over the first 40,000,000 lines of
`data/pt.txt.gz` (213M tokens, 439k types) with a simple lowercase regex
tokenizer that splits on hyphens. 400 forms drawn with a fixed seed (20260912),
stratified by rank: 130 from ranks 1–1000, 150 from 1001–10000, 120 from
10001–40000. Raw sample in `lemma_gold_sample_source.tsv`.

Columns: `claude_lemma` is a first-pass guess; `category` flags proper nouns,
foreign words, contractions, typos, tokenizer artifacts and convention
decisions; `note` explains the tricky ones. `jim_lemma` / `jim_verdict`
(ok / fix / drop) are the human review — the gold standard is whatever is in
`jim_lemma` when non-empty, else `claude_lemma`, for rows whose verdict is not
`drop`.

## `ser_ir_sample.tsv` — gold for the ser/ir rule

100 corpus lines containing `foi`, `fui`, `fomos`, `foram` or `fora`, 20
per form, drawn uniformly at random from the whole corpus (reservoir
sampling, seed 20260912; `python -m scripts.serir` regenerates it and
refuses to overwrite labels). It tests the next-word rule that splits
these forms between *ser* and *ir*, because the tagger cannot: it assigns
them to *ser* almost regardless of context.

Columns: `form`, `sentence`, `line_no`, `rule_guess` (the rule's answer
when the sample was drawn: `ser`, `ir`, or `?` where it abstains),
`informant_label`, and `human_label`, the gold:

- `ser` — "was" (*foi feito*, *fui eu*)
- `ir` — "went" (*fui ao médico*, *fomos buscar ajuda*)
- `other` — not a form of either verb: the adverb *fora* ("outside") in
  19 of the 20 `fora` rows.

The first occurrence of the form in a line is the one labeled, and the one
the rule reads. Subtitle text repeats, so a line can be drawn twice.
`python -m scripts.serir --score` scores the current rule against
`human_label` and writes `reports/serir_scores.md`; the build applies the
rule to the counts only while that score is at least 95% for the rule as
it currently stands.

`ser_ir_sample.tsv` / `ser_ir_sample_context.csv` — 100 corpus lines (20 per
form: foi, fui, fomos, foram, fora) with the two subtitle lines before and
after (`line_no` locates the occurrence in `data/pt.txt.gz`). `rule_guess`
is `scripts/serir.py`'s next-word rule. `informant_label` was produced by an
LLM acting as a European-Portuguese informant, following
`ser_ir_informant_prompt.md`; the advisor checked all 100 independently and
Jim reviewed the seven rows where the rule or the informant was unsure, and
adopted the informant's labels as `human_label` (the gold). Labels: `ser`,
`ir`, `other` (the adverb *fora* "outside", 19 of the 20 *fora* rows).

`ser_ir_sample2.tsv` — a second, held-out sample of 100 lines (20 per form,
drawn with seed 20260922 from every corpus line containing one of the five
forms, excluding lines and sentences used in the first sample; rows are
shuffled). Labelled by a native-speaker Portuguese teacher through a
web page (labels ser / ir / outro, an "unsure" flag, and an optional
comment). This sample was never used to develop the rule; it is the test
set. `scripts/serir.py` must be scored against it without modification.

Sample 2 labels arrived 2026-09-23: 99 labelled (t075 abstained — *Não, fui!*
is too short to decide without the film). The teacher reported that the
neighbouring lines, although they are the true adjacent lines in
`pt.txt.gz`, usually did not read as a coherent scene. So adjacent lines in
the OPUS OpenSubtitles monolingual file are NOT reliable dialogue context:
the corpus appears to be deduplicated / reordered / interleaved across
subtitle versions. Sentence-level counts and tagging are unaffected, but
"sample sentences" in this project should be read as isolated lines, never
as scenes, and future annotation tasks should not rely on neighbours.
